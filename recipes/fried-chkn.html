    <h3>Mom's Homemade Fried Chicken</h3>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (3 pound) frying chicken, cut up</li>
      <li>2 cups buttermilk</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon poultry seasoning</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon celery seeds</li>
      <li>Vegetable oil for deep-frying</li>
      <li>2 cups Kikkoman Tempura Batter Mix</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Wash chicken and pat dry. In a large bowl, stir together buttermilk,
        garlic powder, onion powder, poultry seasoning and celery seeds. Place
        chicken in buttermilk mixture and refrigerate at least 8 hours or
        overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large frying pan or wok, heat oil to 325 degrees F. Drain chicken
        in a colander to remove excess buttermilk. Place tempura batter mix in a
        large paper bag; add chicken. Close top and gently shake bag to coat
        chicken with tempura batter mix. Remove chicken and fry, turning pieces
        over after 3 minutes. Continue to fry, turning occasionally, until
        browned on all sides.
